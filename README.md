# ♻️ ReVive – Upcycle Idea Generator

## Project Title  
**ReVive – A Minimal Tool to Inspire Sustainable DIY Upcycling Projects**

## Problem Statement Addressed  
**"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"**

## Project Overview  
**ReVive** is a static, lightweight web app that provides users with simple, creative, and sustainable upcycling ideas using common household waste. The app promotes eco-awareness through hands-on crafting, making reuse both educational and fun. It’s completely front-end based, needing no backend or database.

The user interface displays idea cards (e.g., bottle planter, tote bag from a shirt), which users can explore or randomly generate. Each card opens a detailed step-by-step guide with tools, materials, tags, and measurements. A real-time search feature also helps filter projects by name or category.

## Key Features  
- 🎲 **Random Idea Generator**  
  Replaces the “Feeling Lucky” button with “🔁 Random Idea” to show one random card at a time.

- 📦 **DIY Idea Cards**  
  Grid of clickable cards for each upcycling idea with tags, difficulty, and duration.

- 🔍 **Search Bar**  
  Filters ideas in real-time based on keywords or tags like "Plastic", "Decor", or "Kids".

  Click any card to see an expanded view with:
  - Step-by-step instructions  
  - Materials and measurements  
  - Tips and tools  
  - Smooth open/close animation
